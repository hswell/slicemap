# Slicemap

Slicemap is designed to enhance the efficiency of adding, inserting, deleting, and updating operations on maps, while also improving the efficiency of traversing arrays and garbage collection (GC) performance.

When dealing with a data volume of around 500,000, Slicemap offers the following advantages:

- Traversal efficiency that is 10-15 times faster.
- Approximately 5 times better GC performance.
- Similar efficiency in adding, inserting, deleting, and updating operations compared to traditional maps.
